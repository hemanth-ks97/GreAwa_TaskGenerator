# Gre Awa Task Generator
Scrapes the official GRE Analytical Writing question bank and stores it on a local database. The final version of the application would present the user with an issue task followed by an argument task from the database with a 30 min timer for each task to simulate the environment of the GRE Writing section (Under development).

# UPDATE

ETS has deprecated the links to the question bank and have replaced it with pdf files. The Web Scraping abilities of the project is hence compromised. However, a copy of the database file retrieved in 2021 by the Web Scraper containing 300+ essay prompts has been uploaded to the repo.

# STEPS TO USE

1. Install bs4 on your local machine

    pip3 install bs4

2. Run the consumer.py python file on your terminal

    python3 consumer.py
