# GreAwa_TaskGenerator
Scrapes the official GRE Analytical Writing question bank and stores it on a local database. The final application would present the user with an issue task followed by an argument task from the database with a 30 min timer for each task to simulate the environment of the GRE Writing section.

# UPDATE

ETS has deprecated the links to the question bank and have replaced it with pdf files. This project no longer works.
